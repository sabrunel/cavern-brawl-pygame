## Project overview

### Resources

### Requirements

Requirements for using this code are available in the `requirements.txt` file.

Each package can be installed using the Pip command, or in conda with:

`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`


### Run the generator

Open the command line and navigate to the folder containing `main.py`

Then simply type:

`python main.py`

Select an enemy to attack it, then watch as the turn unfolds. Keep attacking enemies or use health potions to regain HP.


## What I learned

With this project I wanted to get a better understanding of OOP with Python, while creating something fun.
